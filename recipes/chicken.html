    <h2>Garlic Chicken Fried Chicken</h2>
    <p>This actually uses my breading for Chicken Fried Steak---my husband suggested we try it with chicken breasts, and it was
    delicious!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <br>
        <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <br>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <br>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>

    <h2>How to make Garlic Chicken Fried Chicken</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish,
        whisk together the milk and egg.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then
        dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
        Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
